# :rocket: IBM Data Science Capstone Project
## :page_facing_up: Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space 
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the 
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we 
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost 
of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants 
to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
## :page_facing_up: Questions
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
**Task:** Predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully.
## :page_facing_up: Methodology
  ### 1. Data Collection
  - Using SpaceX Rest API
  - Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
  ### 2. Data Wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and SQL
  ### 4. Developed interactive visualizations using Plotly and Folium
  ### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
  - Building, tuning, and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best
  results
